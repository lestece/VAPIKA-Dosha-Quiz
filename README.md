## 1. INTRODUCTION

This is an interactive front-end site created to provide users with a quiz __to discover their unique Ayurvedic Dosha and obtain lifestyle/diet recommendations based on the quiz result__.

The quiz contains 18 questions and each question has 3 different answer options that correspond to a specific dosha. 

The result is based on which doshas score the highest points in the quiz.

I've created this quiz to showcase my HTML, CSS and JavaScript knowledge, along with my skills relating responsiveness, accessibility and UX Design.

## 2. USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN

### USER PERSONA & THEIR GOALS/NEEDS

As a user, I want to:

- discover my unique mind-body composition
- get clear and concise information about what the quiz does and how I can use the results
- take a quiz that is not too time consuming (avoid too many questions)
- have the option to subscribe to the Newsletter and discover/learn more about my result
- have the option to opt out of the Newsletter
- being redirected to an interactive/engaging result after taking the quiz, where information given is not too crowded but clear and controlled by my inputs
- being left with the feeling of knowing more about myself after taking the quiz and more knowledgeable about how to tackle possible health issues

- - - 
### BUSINESS GOALS

- to provide users with a quiz to discover their dosha and interactive/entertaining information about Ayurveda
- promote the brand name so that in the future it could become a wider Ayurvedic services provider
- keep the users engaged with the brand through a subscription to a monthly Newsletter
- - -
### WIREFRAMES

[See wireframes here](docs/wireframes).

All wireframes were created with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).

[Back to top ???](README.md/#vapika-dosha-quiz)
- - - 
### DESIGN

- #### LOGO

VAPIKA logo was created by me using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/).

![Vapika Logo](assets/images/vapika-logo.png)
- - - 
- #### COLORS

![Vapika Palette](docs/README-images/vapika-palette.png)

The palette was generated from the background image found in the desktop design using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/).

- __#9F7E74 (beige color)__ has been used for the logo, some backgrounds on the website (buttons and main container), for most headings and for the footer background. Also used as a text color when the background is the color below;

- __#E7E8EA (grey/white color)__ was mostly used in the text appearing on backgrounds of the color stated above (quiz questions, sign up form and results heading), for some other backgrounds (buttons, body background), social media icons in the footer;

- I wanted to keep a good contrast across all of the pages and their elements so a regular __black color__ was used for most of the paragraphs, and for some buttons text. 
 
- - -

- #### ICONS
  Icons were needed for the social media links and have been taken from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

- - - 
- #### TYPOGRAPHY

The chosen fonts for the website are:

1. **Tenor Sans**: used for the headings, it's an elegant sans-serif designed by Denis Masharov with excellent legibility.

2. **Sen**: a friendly sans-serif used for paragraphs due to its easy readability.

- - - 
- #### IMAGES

The image used for the homepage background for large screen designs, was taken from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).

The images representing the natural elements that introduce each dosha result were created by me using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/).

All images were optimized using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/).

- - - 
- #### MOCKUPS

After ideating the website structure and the wireframes, and after having decided on the design elements, I've created high-fidelity mockups of all of the pages to make tangible the idea in my mind and have a detailed guide to follow when coding.

## 3. FEATURES

### EXISTING FEATURES

- #### HOMEPAGE

![Homepage](docs/README-images/homepage.png)

The homepage contains:

- a __catchy introduction__ that informs users about the website's main purpose 

- a button that opens a modal window containing __more information__ about Ayurveda and generalities that are important for understanding the quiz results

- a button opening a modal window that provides users with instructions on __how to take the quiz__

- a button to __start the quiz__
- - - 
- #### HOMEPAGE MODAL WINDOWS

![Homepage modals](docs/README-images/homepage-modals.gif)

For easy navigation, modal windows opened through the "Learn more" and "Instructions" buttons on the homepage __can be closed both by clicking on the "close x button" and by clicking anywhere outside of the modal window__.
- - - 
- #### QUIZ PAGE

![Quiz page](docs/README-images/quiz-page.png)

The quiz page displays each question and its related 3 different answers one below another.

When the "next" button is clicked, the JavaScript _checks that an answer has been selected_ and if so, _the selected answer gets stored and the next question displayed_.
- - - 
- #### ANSWER SELECTION/UNSELECTION

![Answer selection](docs/README-images/answer-selection.gif)

Event listeners related to the answer selection are only applied to the "next question" button, so that _users can change their mind after selecting one answer and control when they're ready to submit their answer and proceed with the next question_.

In case users select a different answer, __the previous selected one gets unselected__.
- - - 
- #### UNANSWERED QUESTION

![Unanswered question](docs/README-images/unanswered-question.gif)

For the purpose of getting an accurate result, the quiz is structured so that __each question requires an answer__.

If users try to skip a question or forget to select an answer, __an alert window is displayed__ to inform them about the quiz requirements and prompt them to answer.
- - - 
- #### NEWSLETTER SIGNUP FORM

![Signup form](docs/README-images/signup-page.png)

After the quiz completion, users are redirected to a page containing a _Newsletter signup form_ that requires them to input their _name, email address and a quiz feedback_.

The Newsletter signing up is completely __optional__ and users can skip it by simply clicking on the "Skip and go to results button".
- - - 
- #### NEWSLETTER SIGNUP CONFIRMATION ALERT WINDOW
![Signup confirmation alert](docs/README-images/signup-confirmation-alert.gif)

If the form is correctly submitted, __an alert window confirms to users that they've successfully subscribed to the Newsletter__.

With a _4 second timer_, the alert window __redirects to the results page__.
- - - 
- #### NEWSLETTER SIGNUP CONFIRMATION EMAIL
![Signup confirmation email](docs/README-images/newsletter-email.png)

If the form is successfully submitted, __users also get a personalized confirmation email__ that displays their name and lets them know what to expect from the Newsletter.
- - - 

- #### QUIZ RESULT PAGE
![Quiz result page](docs/README-images/quiz-result.png)

After introducing the users to their dosha, the quiz result page __features a Google Pie chart__ that displays what percentage each dosha has been scored.

A _color legend_ helps the user understand the Pie chart more.
- - -
- #### PERSONALIZED RESULTS
![Personalized resuls](docs/README-images/personalized-result.png)

If the user decides to signup to the Newsletter, the __username submitted through the form is stored and displayed in the results page heading__. This creates more _emotional engagement_ and the user is reassured that he/she is getting a _tailored result_.

- - - 

- #### INTERACTIVE PIE CHART
![Interactive Pie Chart](docs/README-images/interactive-pie-chart.gif)

The Pie Chart used to display the quiz results is __fully interactive__: 

- by __hovering__ on each slice, the user gets __the name of the dosha__, it's corresponding __number of questions answered __and, based on the number of the quiz total question, on what __percentage__ that dosha is present.

- by __cliking__ on each slice, a __modal window opens__, giving the user a __full explanation of that specific dosha, and tips and recommendations to keep it in balance__.
- - - 
- #### FOOTER
![Footer](docs/README-images/footer.png)

The footer is consistent across all of the pages and contains the social media buttons that open on a new page.

- - - 

### FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT IN THE FUTURE

- Adding e-commerce functionality through expanding each dosha's detailed explanation and "remedies" by offering a selection of Ayurvedic products that can help balance that dosha. 

- Changing the question answering system: instead of having to click on the "next question" button at each question, the clicked answer is the one that triggers the new question displaying.
In addition, the user would be able to go back to the previous questions and, for any reason, change the answer given.
