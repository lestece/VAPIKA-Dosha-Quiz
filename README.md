## 1. INTRODUCTION

This is an interactive front-end site created to provide users with a quiz __to discover their unique Ayurvedic Dosha and obtain lifestyle/diet recommendations based on the quiz result__.

The quiz contains 18 questions and each questions has 3 different answer options, that correspond to a specific dosha. 

The result is based on which doshas score the highest points in the quiz.

I've created this quiz to showcase my HTML, CSS and JavaScript knowledge, along with my skills relating responsitivity, accessibility and UX Design.

## 2. USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN

### USER PERSONA & THEIR GOALS/NEEDS

Users are adults who want to:

- discover their unique mind-body composition
- get clear and concise information about what the quiz does and how to use the results
- take a quiz that is not too time consuming (avoid too many questions)

- have the option to opt out of the Newsletter
- being redirected to an interactive/engaging result after taking the quiz, where information given is not too crowded but clear and controlled by the user input

### DESIGN

- #### LOGO

VAPIKA logo was created by me using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/).

![Vapika Logo](assets/images/vapika-logo.png)

- #### COLORS

![Vapika Palette](docs/README-images/vapika-palette.png)

The palette was generated from the background image found in the desktop design using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/).

- __#9F7E74 (beige color)__ has been used for the logo, some backgrounds in the website (buttons and main container), for most headings and for the footer background. Also used as a text color when the background is the color below;

- __#E7E8EA (grey/white color)__ was mostly used in the text appearing on backgrounds of the color stated above (quiz questions, sign up form and results heading), for some other backgrounds (buttons, body background), social media icons in the footer;

- I wanted to keep a good contrast across all of the pages and their elements so a regular __black color__ was used for most of the paragraphs, and for some buttons text.

- #### ICONS
  Icons were needed for the social media links and have been taken from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

- #### TYPOGRAPHY

The chosen fonts for the website are:

1. **Tenor Sans**: used for the headings, it's an elegant sans-serif designed by Denis Masharov with excellent legibility.

2. **Sen**: a friendly sans-serif used for paragraphs due to its easy readability.

- #### IMAGES

The image used for the homepage background for large screen designs, was taken from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).

The images representing the natural elements that introduce each dosha result were created by me using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/).

All images were optimized using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/).

- #### MOCKUPS

After ideating the website structure and the wireframes, and after having decided the design elements, I've created high-fidelity mockups of all of the pages to make tangible the idea in my mind and have a detailed guide to follow when coding.
