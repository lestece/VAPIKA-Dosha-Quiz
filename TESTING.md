-On click, the slice correctly opens the modal window containing the information for that specific dosha

### EXTERNAL LINKS

### EMAILJS
![EmailJS Testing](docs/README-images/newsletter-email.png)
The signup form submission successfully sends a confirmation email to the user based on the email address stated in the form.

Also the username is shown to be correctly stored and displayed in the email intro.

To make sure the feature is working, I tested it using various email addresses (mine or relative's/friend's) ones and different names.

### QUIZ & QUIZ RESULT
The quiz logic revolves around the concept that the user dominant doshas are the ones that get more answers: each question has three possible answers and each answer corresponds to a specific dosha. 
To make things easier, answer 1 [0] always corresponds to Vata, answer 2[1] to Pitta and answer 3 [2] to Kapha.

Knowing this, I manually tested all of the possible combinations, including a Tridoshic case (all doshas get equal points) to make sure the results are being calculated correctly.
