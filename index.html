                    <h1>Ayurveda Fundamentals</h1>
                    <p>Ayurveda is an ancient holistic healing system developed in India more than 3,000 years ago.
                        It's based on the principle that the 5 elements - earth, fire, water, air and space - found in the Universe also exist within our bodies. They combine in varying degrees to form the so-called "doshas" (also known as energetic forces of nature or functional principles): they are Vata (Air and Space), Pitta (Fire and Water) and Kapha (Water and Earth).
                        Each person has a varying amount of each element and a unique combination of the doshas,
                        that describe one's unique constitution (Prakruti in Ayurveda). </p>
                        <p>Ayurveda's main purpose is to promote good health and prevent disease,  revolving around the idea that health and wellness depend on a delicate balance between the body, mind and spirit.</p>
                        <p>The elements govern the way our body responds to the outside influences: food, habits, weather, environment. So the more you learn about the doshas and your Prakruti, the more you are able to make the right choices to bring the body back to a state of health and balance.</p>

                    <h1>How to take the test & what to do with the results</h1>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Read each question carefully and choose the answer that best describes you.</li>
                        <li>Answer each question as objectively and honestly as possible, focusing on what has been true for you throughout your life. If you are struggling with a choice, choose according to what best reflects your healthiest, most vibrant period of life. </li>
                    <li>The quiz result will probably show that you have a dominant dosha, and a second one that is less obvious. So for example, you would be Pitta-Vata, Kapha-Pitta etc. You should generally focus on balancing your dominant dosha and following its guidelines, but also always being aware of your second dosha's tendencies and signs of imbalance.</li>
                    <li></li>If you end up with a Tridoshic result (when you have an even amount of all of the three doshas), it means you have a fairly balanced constitution. If this is the case, Ayurveda suggests that you follow a Vata diet and its guidelines because it's the first dosha that goes out of balance.</li>
