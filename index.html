                    <h1 class="homepage-modal">Ayurveda Fundamentals</h1>
                    <p class="intro">Ayurveda is an ancient <span class="bold-text italic-text">holistic healing
                            system</span> developed in India more than <span class="italic-text">3,000 years ago</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>It's based on the principle that the 5 elements - <span class="bold-text">Earth, Fire, Water, Air
                            and Space</span> - found in the Universe also exist within our bodies. <br> <br>
                        These elements <span class="italic-text">combine in varying degrees</span> to form the so-called
                        <span class="bold-text">"doshas"</span> (also known as <span class="italic-text">energetic
                            forces of nature or functional principles</span>):
                        they are <span class="bold-text">Vata</span> (Air and Space), <span
                            class="bold-text">Pitta</span> (Fire and Water) and <span class="bold-text">Kapha</span>
                        (Water and Earth). <br><br>
                        Each person has a <span class="italic-text">varying amount of each element and a unique
                            combination of the doshas</span>,
                        that describe one's unique constitution (<span class="bold-text">Prakruti</span> in Ayurveda).
                    </p>
                    <p class="intro">Ayurveda's main purpose is to <span class="bold-text">promote good health and
                            prevent disease</span>, revolving around the idea that health and wellness depend on <span
                            class="italic-text">a delicate balance between the body, mind and spirit.</span></p>
                    <p>The elements govern the way <span class="bold-text">our body responds to the outside
                            influences</span>: <span class="italic-text">food, habits, weather, environment</span>. <br>
                        So the more you learn about the doshas and your Prakruti, the <span class="italic-text">more you
                            are able to make the right choices to bring the body back to a state of <span
                                class="bold-text">health and balance!</span></span></p>

                    <h1>How to take the test & what to do with the results</h1>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Read each question <span class="italic-text">carefully</span> and <span class="bold-text">choose the answer that best describes you</span>.</li>
                        <li>Answer each question <span class="bold-text">as objectively and honestly as possible</span>, focusing on what has been true
                            for you throughout your life. If you are struggling with a choice, <span class="italic-text">choose according to what
                            best reflects your healthiest, most vibrant period of life.</span></li>
                        <li>The quiz result will probably show that you have a <span class="bold-text">dominant dosha</span>, and a second one that is
                            less obvious. So for example, you would be Pitta-Vata, Kapha-Pitta etc. You should generally
                            <span class="italic-text">focus on balancing your dominant dosha</span> and following its guidelines, but also <span class="bold-text">always being
                            aware of your second dosha's tendencies and signs of imbalance.</span></li>
                        <li>If you end up with a <span class="bold-text">Tridoshic result</span> (<span class="italic-text">when you have an even amount of all of the three
                            doshas</span>), it means you have a fairly balanced constitution. If this is the case, Ayurveda
                            suggests that you <span class="bold-text">follow a Vata diet and its guidelines</span> because it's the first dosha that
                            goes out of balance.</li>
